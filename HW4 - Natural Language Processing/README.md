This homework utilized Natural Language Processing to conduct a Sentiment Classification based on data extracted from `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`. 

The key steps include:
1. Data ETL
2. Converting the utterances into a sparse bag-of-words (BOW) representation
3. Reflection on the shortcoming of the previous representation of utterance features
4. Normalization using TF-IDF
5. Build a SGD classifier and perfrom error analysis
6. Build a classifier using pre-trained word embeddings
7. Build a classifier based on BERT and MLP
8. More reflections and short answer questions
