In this homework, we will implement AlexNet-like deep, convolutional neural network (CNN) with PyTorch. We are going to use the CNN to classify flowers into the 102 categories.

The homework consists of the following parts:

- Load and prepare data
- Load a pretrained Alexnet in PyTorch
- Set up transfer learning for flower classification problem
- Train the model
- Model performance monitoring and analysis with learning curve
- Questions regarding the design choices
